A Mario like Game in Java.


To play this game download the PiCorama.jar file on your system ( you can see the code of this file in this repository ).
You should have Java installed on your work station to run this game.


--Side Note: The game was made to learn about tech and mechanics like The GameLoop, Rendering, UpdateLoop, LevelCreation using a mix of 2 2D arrays configuring the level template and sprite insertions in that template, gravity, movement, inputs, etc, that's why the game isn't finished and will probably never get finished. It was just a project to learn Java on a fundamental level and to learn Game Development on a fundamental level as well.
